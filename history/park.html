<h2><span class="celColor">|CelMod| Map History - Park</span><br>
</h2>
<p><span class="view">Description</span><br>
<a>Park is the home map of the <b>|CelMod| Server</b>. It is the first map in the map cycle and is the decider of what map<br>
comes next. The second map used to be randomized until complaints about playing the same map twice led it to<br>
its own cycle. Park is updated every 6 months or so to fit the current season that the server is in. Depending on<br>
the season, Park can either be sunny and warm or dark and cold. The main areas in Park are Areas 1 and 2,<br>
which are both empty build areas meant for straight up building without the use of external scenery. The Park<br>
area itself is usually the most popular area which players occupy. The current version of Park has an NPC<br>
dungeon which can be accessed by entering under the exit sign in the Park HQ building.<br>

<a>Before becoming the map that the map cycle only began on, Park started out as the only map in the cycle at all.<br>
Each map used to last 3 hours long as opposed to 1, meaning Park would restart every 3 hours unless the next<br>
map was changed by an admin. Later on, the map cycle included more maps such as Construct and Flatgrass.<br>
The original version of Park was very primitive compared to today's version. However, it did have some striking<br>
similarities such as the HQ building, Dr. Breen, and the surrounding fence. Park was originally named "gm_park",<br>
which was made by an unknown player. The server hosted the original version of Park along with a modified version<br>
snowy version called "gm_park_snow". This and other modifications of the original Park were made by Celsius.<br>
The server would go on to host the original Park until a few days after the server went online. At this point,<br>
the server was hosted on Celsius's computer and could only hold 10 players. The server changed its name to<br>
<b>|CelMod| Build/RP</b> and used the first official <b>|CelMod|</b> Park map named "gm_park_cm".<br>
</a>
<br>

<a>The first modification of Park by Celsius. This version was made before <b>|CelMod|</b> launched its own server. In fact it<br>
was made only 2 weeks after <b>Project |CelMod|</b> started, on <b>QwertyCody's Build Server</b>. This version of Park<br>
contains some very early scenery changes such as graffiti inside the HQ building and a slot for players to obtain<br>
gravity guns inside. This is the only version of Park that was never used on the official <b>|CelMod| Server</b>.<br>
</a>
<br>

<a>The second modification of Park by Celsius. This version was made shortly after the <b>|CelMod| Server</b> began<br>
beta testing. It was the first modification of Park to be used on the server and also the last. Each modification of<br>
Park after this one was an update that would replace the previous. This map however, was played while the<br>
original park was still the default map. So there were 2 versions of Park being used at the same time.<br>
This map was exactly the same as the original Park map, except that it was covered in snow.<br>
</a>
<br>
<span class="view">gm_park_cm</span><br>
<img src="images/4.png"/><br>
<a>The first official update of Park included a now talking Dr. Breen who greeted players with the word "Welcome",<br>
along with an above ground pool. This version of Park was used for the remaining week before the server's official<br>
launch on December 26th, 2009. Once the server went official, Park was updated to "gm_park_cm2".<br>
</a>
<br>

<a>Once the server went official, there were 2 servers for a very short period of time. While both hosted the updated Park<br>
map, the transition from the old server to the new one was not well accepted. At first, the official server was VAC protected<br>
while the original was not. They became known as the VAC and Non-VAC server. A few days later this was fixed when<br>
the official server went Non-VAC and all the original players made the transition. The updated Park map didn't offer<br>
anything more to the regular player than first updated map did. However, it did offer the admin's a new secret room they<br>
could hide in. The admin room was located on the second floor of the Park HQ building and included a surveillance monitor<br>
and one-sided windows. The admin room was accessible only by admins who flew inside. Any players or objects that<br>
attempted to go inside were automatically teleported above the pool. The Park map itself did not have any updates to its<br>
scenery. This led the players to create some scenery for the new Park map using props. The only props that were accepted<br>
were created by a player named Standers37. He created a melon booth, Dr. Breen's office, a zombie hideout/weapons shop,<br>
and the famous scene where Eli runs himself over with a car. Celsius contributed by making a scene of Dr. Breen wearing<br>
a chef hat and cooking. Most of this scenery still remains in Park today. Despite receiving a small amount of updates to<br>
its previous version, this version of Park would remain on the server for 3 months up until March 3rd, 2010, a full<br>
year after <b>Project |CelMod|</b> began.<br>
</a>

<a>In order to give tribute to a year of <b>Project |CelMod|</b>, the Park map was updated to its 3rd official version. At first<br>
glance, the only update this version of Park got was an in-ground pool instead of an above ground one. However, below<br>
the ground was another dimension of Park that players had never seen. This introduced a second area which players<br>
could build in called the Underground area. This area was dark and empty with the exception of an upside down Park<br>
HQ building. The Underground area was literally the above ground area of Park flipped upside down in darkness. It<br>
included an upside down Welcome sign, an upside down admin room, and even an upside down Dr. Breen! With this<br>
addition players could not only build in more than one place to decrease lag, but they could choose to build in day or night.<br>
This version of Park remained the default map longer than any other version. It was updated on August 5th, 2010.<br>

<a>As the first time the server celebrated a holiday, April 1st changed the look of the server completely. <b>|CelMod|</b> was<br>
changed to |CrapMod| for a day which changed the logo from blue to red. There was also an object name change<br>
which made all cel objects called "crap" objects. The biggest update however, was the redesign of Park to fit a more<br>
"crappy" feel. The light green Park grass was turned into a slimey dark green, the pool water was replaced with<br>
poisonous slime, and Dr. Breen refused to welcome anybody to Park. This would only go on for a day, meaning<br>
April 2nd restored Park back to its bright and sunny self.<br>

<a>When the Park map was updated in early August, there was a problem. This was planned to be the version of Park<br>
that introduced the most recognizable features of the map. However there was a glitch in the map's creation that<br>
caused the map to break. This glitch was not discovered until the map was launched on the server, meaning that<br>
a lot of players had already downloaded the broken version before it could be fixed. This caused a server panic<br>
which led to the revival of the previous Park update. Since this version of Park was broken, it is the shortest time<br>
a version of Park was on the server, only lasting about 10 minutes before switching back to the previous Park<br>
version. Hours later, the new Park was fixed and ready to be launched under its new name "gm_park_cm5".

<a>This version of the Park map was the biggest update the map has had to this day. Before this version, Park was<br>
only a park with a pool and an underground area. Once the map was updated it introduced the spawn area which<br>
allowed players to choose between the classic Park area and the new areas simply known as "Area 1" and "Area 2".<br>
These new areas also had underground areas which allowed players to build in a total of 6 different areas. The<br>
spawn area also became the new location for the Guess Booth, which was originally located at the center of the main<br>
Park area. It also introducted the Nextmap preview, giving players a chance to see what the next map looked like.<br>
This version of Park remained on the server for over 4 months until Park got its first seasonal update on Christmas Day 2010.

<a>Almost a year after the official <b>|CelMod|</b> launched, it was given its first white Christmas. Following what happened<br>
to the map Cubicle, Park was covered with snow and the pool was covered up to give way to a new build area.<br>
Not only did the pool make for a new build area, but the undergroud HQ building was turned into the entrance to<br>
the new private build areas. Here players could build quietly and alone if they wanted to. In a year's time, Park<br>
went from 1 build area to 10. Oh, and there was also a snowman.

<a>The winter update for Park would go on to last longer than anybody thought. Originally planned for release on<br>
March 21, 2011, or the first day of spring, the spring update for Park didn't hit until June 21, 2011, the first day<br>
of summer. However, it may have been worth the wait. The pool was re-opened and the scenery of Park was<br>
given a redesign to match the spring season. The dead oak tree was turned into a big, green, and leafy oak tree<br>
with a bench and rose bush. The other trees were also redesigned to appear alive rather than dead and gray.<br>
While there were not any new build areas added, Park did have a huge update that would change the face of the server.<br>
The NPC dungeon was launched and for the first time ever players could kill and earn NPCs. Park would be<br>
the first and only map with a dungeon until Cubeland's Halloween House was turned into a zombie and headcrab dungeon.<br>
